Playing through games and export saves at certain points in the game as I progress.
I do not play in any specific pattern for now, but who knows what the future will bring.
Doing it bit for bit.
In the future there will hopefully be a list with a short description for each save, among with other games too, so you can pick up where you left off or want to play from a specific point in a game.

These saves should work fine with cemu, since they're exported in Cemu's Title Manager.
All you should have to do is to import them.
