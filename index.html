<h1>WiiU Game Saves for Cemu</h1>
<div id="info">
Playing through games and export saves at certain points in the game as I progress. I do not play in any specific pattern for now, but who knows what the future will bring.<br>
Think of it as game saves if you like<br>
Doing it bit for bit. In the future there will hopefully be a list with a short description for each save, among with other games too, so you can pick up where you left off or want to play from a specific point in a game.<br>
<br>
These saves should work fine with cemu, since they're exported in Cemu's Title Manager. All you should have to do is to import them.<br>
</div>

<div id="install">
<h3>How to install the saves</h3>	
Open Cemu, navigate to the <mark>"Title Manager"</mark> select the game and import.<br>
You might have to save in-game once before you're able to import a save<br>
